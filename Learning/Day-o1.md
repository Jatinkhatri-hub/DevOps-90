# Introduction to the DevOps 



# What is DevOps?

- DevOps is comination of software developers (dev) and operations (ops). It is defined as a software engineering methodology which aims to integrate the work of software development and software operations teams by facilitating a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility.

- DevOps can be best explained as people working together to conceive, build and deliver secure software at top speed. DevOps practices enable software developers and operations teams to acclerate delivery through automation, collaboration, fast, feedback, and iterative improvement.

- A DevOps delivery process expands on the cross-functional approach of building and shipping application in a faster and more iterative manner. In adoption a DevOps development process, you are making a decision to improve the flow and value delivery of your application by encouraging a more collaborative environment at all stages of the development cycle.

## What is a DevOps engineer?

- A DevOps engineer is responsible for all aspects of the software development lifecycle, including communicating critical information to the business and customers.

- They efficiently integrate development processes into workflows, introduce automation where possible, and test and analyze code. They build, evaluate, deploy, and update tools and platforms.

- DevOps engineers require knowledge of a range of programming languages and a strong set of communication skills to be able to collaborate among engineering and business groups.

## Core DevOps principles 

- The DevOps methodology comprises four key principles that guide the effectiveness and efficiency of application development and deployment.

    1. Automation of software development lifecycle
    2. Collaboration and communication
    3. Continuous improvement and minimization of waste
    4. Hyperfocus on user needs with short feedback loops <br> <br>
    
- By adopting these principles, organizations can improve code quality, achieve a faster time to market, and engage in better application planning.

## The DevOps lifecycle and how DevOps works


- The DevOps lifecycle stretches from the beginning of software development through to delivery, maintenance and security. The 10 lifecycle stages are:

    1. Manage: DevOps closes the loop and incorporates feedback and learnings from the entire lifecycle into your ongoing iteration.

    2. Plan: DevOps describes the work that needs to be done, prioritize it, and track its completion.

    3. Create: DevOps writes code, proposes changes, and discusses these proposals with coworkers.
    
    4. Verify: DevOps automatically tests code to make sure it works correctly.

    5. Package: DevOps stores the software in a state where it can be reused later.

    6. Secure: DevOps checks whether the software contains vulnerabilities through static and dynamic tests, fuzz testing, and dependency scanning.

    7. Release: DevOps deploys the software to end users.

    8. Configures: DevOps manages infrastructure and software platforms.

    9. Monitor: Devops sees the impact of the software is on inftrastructure and users. It also provides data to help effectively respond to incidents.

    10. Protects: DevOps secure the infrastructure the software is running on by ensuring containers are up to date and locked down.

## Benefits of DevOps

- DevOps break down barriers so that development and operations teams are no longer siloed and have a more efficient way to work across the entire development and application life cycle.

- Without DevOps, organizations experience handoff friction,which delays the delivery of software releases and negatively impacts business result.

- Organizations that have implemented a DevOps culture experience the benefits of increased collaboration, fluid responsivness, and shorter cycle times.
